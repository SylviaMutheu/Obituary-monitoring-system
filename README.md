# Obituary-monitoring-system
An automated obituary monitoring system for attorneys to track deceased clients and notify families about Wills through real-time data scraping from U.S. newspapers.

### 📌 Overview
The Obituary Monitoring System is designed to assist attorneys in tracking and identifying deceased clients by scanning U.S. newspapers for obituary notices. It focuses on monitoring approximately 3,000 client names, starting with newspapers in Indiana, using data scraping techniques from Legacy.com. The system enables timely notifications to the deceased’s family regarding the existence of a Will, ensuring sensitive management of client information.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Automate obituary tracking for 3,000+ client records to alert the attorney of a client's passing.
- Develop a scalable and reliable system capable of scraping obituary data from Legacy.com.
- Ensure legal compliance with website scraping policies and minimize server impact.
- Enable real-time monitoring and document generation for accurate and timely reporting.
- Adapt to website changes by implementing flexible scraping algorithms.
